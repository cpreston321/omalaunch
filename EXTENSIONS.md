# Omalaunch extensions

Every optional launcher feature is an **extension**. Omalaunch supports two delivery methods:

- **Bundled extensions** ship with Omalaunch and are enabled by default.
- **External extensions** are independent, enabled Omarchy plugins.

Both use the same extension format. An external extension with the same `capability` replaces a bundled extension; disabling or removing it restores the bundled extension.

## Extensions directory

Omalaunch gives every resolved bundled and external extension one shortcut in the fixed top-level **Extensions** directory. The directory is always present and cannot be starred. Its shortcuts are ordered with starred extensions first and then alphabetically.

Extension shortcuts do not otherwise appear on the launcher's starting view. Press Ctrl+S on a shortcut to promote it there; the same shortcut remains in **Extensions**, and Ctrl+S removes it from both views. Favorites use the extension provider's stable `id`, so a replacement does not inherit the shortcut or its starred state. Extension roots are also included in global search whether or not they are starred.

The **Add Extension** shortcut contains **Create with Agent**. Create with Agent asks for a name, creates a development workspace with a minimal `manifest.json`, `omalaunch.json`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md`, and opens the user's default Omarchy coding agent there with the extension contract in its initial prompt. The plugin ID and directory use `<username>.<extension-slug>`, consistent with Omarchy's local plugin convention. Workspaces use `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/` by default, where Omarchy discovers local plugins. Set `extensionDevelopmentDirectory` in `~/.config/omarchy/omalaunch/config.jsonc` to select another parent directory; `~` and environment variables are expanded.

Activating a shortcut enters the interface appropriate to its mode:

- `files` opens the file browser.
- `emoji` opens the emoji grid.
- A prefixed `query` or `prefix` extension focuses input with its prefix prepared.
- A query-only extension focuses an empty, extension-specific input (for example Calculator and Currency conversion).
- `workflow` opens its first host-rendered workflow stage.
- `menu` runs its provider and opens the returned host-rendered action menu.

Unavailable extensions remain listed with their missing dependency detail. Only dependencies in Omalaunch's own trusted setup allow-list offer an installation confirmation; other unavailable shortcuts cannot dispatch a command.

A summon may name an extension capability instead of a menu id, so a compositor
keybinding can open one directly:

```bash
omarchy-shell shell summon quantumfire.omalaunch '{"extension":"emoji"}'
```

The capability is resolved through the same replacement rules as its shortcut,
so a configured or higher-priority provider answers the summon. The extension
catalog loads asynchronously; the request is held until it resolves and then
enters the extension, so the launcher never appears to ignore the keybinding.
An unknown capability is diagnosed and leaves the ordinary starting view.

## External plugin manifest

An Omarchy plugin declares its extension files in `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "example.omalaunch-pi",
  "name": "Omalaunch: Pi",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Example",
  "description": "Launch Pi prompts from Omalaunch",
  "kinds": ["extension"],
  "entryPoints": {},
  "omalaunch": {
    "extensions": ["omalaunch.json"]
  }
}
```

Paths must be relative to the plugin directory, may not contain `..` segments, and must resolve inside that directory (including through symlinks). Omalaunch only loads contributions from plugins reported as enabled by `omarchy plugin list --json`. If the same enabled plugin `id` has manifests in both roots, the Omarchy-managed `OMARCHY_PATH/shell/plugins` manifest wins over `~/.config/omarchy/plugins`; lexical path order breaks ties within one root. Shadowed manifests are diagnosed and do not receive a second provider or definition budget.

The original `omalaunch.queryProviders` manifest field remains accepted as an alias for compatibility.

### Development layout

Published external extensions should use their own source repository. **Add Extension** follows Omarchy's local plugin-development model and creates new projects in `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/` by default, so Omarchy discovers them without a manual copy step. Omarchy watches that directory and can reload the shell while files change. Set `extensionDevelopmentDirectory` when an isolated source checkout is preferred; install a stable snapshot in the plugin directory for live testing.

The extension directory repository lists available extensions; it does not contain their source code. One plugin repository can provide several extension definitions, but each definition provides one capability and has its own stable extension `id`.

## Your own extensions

Authoring an Omarchy plugin is proportionate for something the size of a camera
panel and absurd for a one-file prefix extension. Definitions dropped into a
user-owned root load with no plugin around them:

```
~/.config/omarchy/omalaunch/extensions.d/<name>/extension.json   with helper files beside it
~/.config/omarchy/omalaunch/extensions.d/<name>.json             when there are none
```

Both layouts mirror how bundled extensions are laid out, and the format is the
same schema-version-1 definition used everywhere else — the same validation,
the same dependency checks, the same budgets, the same diagnostics. If you can
write a bundled extension you can write one of these. `{extensionDir}` resolves
to the definition's own directory, so a helper script lives beside the file
that calls it:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "my.notes",
  "capability": "notes",
  "mode": "prefix",
  "label": "Notes",
  "prefixes": ["note"],
  "command": ["{extensionDir}/bin/note", "{prompt}"]
}
```

A directory may generate its definitions instead of declaring them. An
executable named `provider` is run, and its stdout is read exactly as a
plugin's `extensionProviders` output is — one extension object or an array of
them:

```
~/.config/omarchy/omalaunch/extensions.d/<name>/provider
```

There is no manifest here to declare a provider in, and inventing a second file
format for a root whose whole point is removing ceremony would defeat it, so
the executable is the declaration — as it is in any `conf.d`. It runs with its
own directory as the working directory and draws from the **same provider
budget as plugins**: the documented ceilings are per catalog load, so a second
source does not get a second allowance. A `provider` file that has lost its
executable bit — which is what copying a directory out of an archive does — is
diagnosed by name rather than skipped silently.

This is deliberately not the `extensions/` directory beside it: that holds
per-capability settings files such as `files.jsonc`, and definitions sitting
among them would be a confusing collision.

Files that are not `.json` are ignored without comment; a `.json` file that
does not parse is diagnosed by path and does not discard its valid neighbours.
An absent `extensions.d` is the normal case and says nothing.

### Which provider wins

When more than one extension claims a capability, resolution is, in order:

1. A capability disabled in configuration is dropped entirely.
2. A provider named explicitly in `config.jsonc` `capabilities` wins.
3. An available extension beats an unavailable one.
4. A higher `priority` wins.
5. Failing all that, the more specific source wins: **your own file, then an
   installed plugin, then bundled.**

Rule 5 is why the root exists — dropping in a definition for a capability
Omalaunch already ships replaces it, and deleting the file restores the
original. Because that shadowing is easy to forget, replacing a *plugin* this
way is diagnosed by name, so a user file left behind after installing the
plugin it was overriding does not read as the plugin being broken.

### Trust

Same boundary as a plugin, and worth being blunt about: a definition here runs
arbitrary commands as you, with your environment and your files. The root
lowers the effort of installing an extension, not the risk of one. Argument
arrays prevent accidental shell-string injection; they are not a sandbox.

## Dynamic extension catalogs

An enabled plugin may generate extension definitions when Omalaunch loads or refreshes its catalog:

```json
{
  "omalaunch": {
    "extensions": ["static-extension.json"],
    "extensionProviders": [
      ["./bin/generate-extensions", "--format", "json"],
      ["catalog-tool", "--plugin", "example.omalaunch-tools"]
    ]
  }
}
```

Each `extensionProviders` entry is a non-empty argument array. Omalaunch invokes it directly, never through a shell, with the plugin directory as its working directory and no stdin. Arguments are passed literally: shell expansion, pipes, redirects, variable expansion, and command substitution do not occur.

Executable resolution is explicit:

- An executable containing `/` is a plugin-relative path. It must resolve inside the plugin directory and have its executable bit set. Absolute paths and paths that escape through `..` or a symlink are rejected.
- An executable without `/` is looked up on Omalaunch's `PATH`.
- Other arguments are opaque strings; Omalaunch does not resolve or interpolate them.

A provider writes either one extension object or an array of extension objects to stdout. These are the same schema-version-1 definitions used by static extension files and pass through the same `MenuModel` validation, dependency checks, capability resolution, and duplicate detection. Provider definitions are external (not bundled), and their source directory is the plugin root. This is a one-shot catalog-generation contract: providers are not persistent processes and cannot answer launcher queries as an RPC service.

Provider loading is deliberately bounded: at most 16 providers per plugin and 64 providers total are considered; each provider has a five-second timeout and a 256 KiB limit on each output stream; all providers together receive at most 15 seconds of execution time. Plugin discovery across the managed and user roots examines at most 4,096 immediate filesystem entries, discovers/parses at most 512 manifests, and reads at most 4 MiB of manifest data in aggregate. The managed root is considered first and bounded candidate batches are processed lexically; exhausting any shared discovery budget emits one diagnostic and skips the remainder. Each individual manifest is capped at 256 KiB and may contribute at most 128 static file declarations. Bundled and external static extension files may consume at most 1 MiB of input in aggregate, and one static file or provider result may contribute at most 256 definitions. The resulting catalog accepts at most 1,024 definitions and its complete JSON output is capped at 768 KiB, with definition bytes enforced incrementally as entries are appended. Diagnostics are capped at 256 messages of 1,024 characters each.

Every parsed JSON source—the enabled-plugin list, plugin manifests, static definitions, and provider output—is limited to 32 nested object/array levels, counting its outer container as level one. Depth is checked iteratively before annotation or serialization; level 32 is accepted and level 33 is rejected. All JSON inputs are also strict: `NaN`, `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, floating-point overflow, and integers outside JavaScript's interoperable safe-integer range are rejected; catalog serialization forbids non-finite values and defensively converts recursion/serialization failures into a valid incomplete loader response. Failure, timeout, oversized, over-depth or malformed output, unsafe paths, missing executables, invalid definitions, duplicate IDs or prefixes, shadowed manifests, and every exhausted aggregate limit are logged with bounded, actionable provenance. One provider's failure or limit does not discard bundled, static, or earlier valid provider extensions.

The loader is a Python 3 program. Python is part of the current standard Omarchy installation and is also an explicit Omalaunch requirement; installations that remove it cannot load or refresh extensions or use the host file index. A transient loader/process failure, oversized loader output, or temporary failure to list enabled plugins leaves the launcher's last known-good catalog active and emits diagnostics instead of replacing it with an empty/partial catalog. Disabling or removing a plugin removes both its static and generated definitions after the next *complete* catalog reload; an explicit Omalaunch refresh reloads immediately.

### Trust boundary

Omarchy plugins are trusted local software. A provider and every extension command it emits run as the current user with the launcher's environment and can access that user's files and services. Argument-array execution prevents accidental shell-string injection but is **not** a sandbox or a defense against a malicious plugin. Only install and enable plugins you trust. Providers should keep generation deterministic, fast, read-only, and free of network access where possible; secrets must not be written into generated definitions or diagnostics.

## Action extension

Action extensions run a command when activated. Nothing opens first — no
prompt, no picker:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "example.camera",
  "capability": "example.camera",
  "mode": "action",
  "label": "Front Driveway",
  "description": "Open in mpv",
  "requires": ["mpv"],
  "command": ["mpv", "rtsp://camera.local/stream"]
}
```

This is the mode for an entry that simply does one thing. A prefix extension
completes its prefix and waits for a prompt, which is wrong for a command that
takes no argument, and every other mode opens a picker first.

`prefixes` is optional here, unlike every other mode that accepts them: an
action is found by its label, so a prefix is a convenience rather than the
mechanism. `{extensionDir}` is substituted in the command.

The command is dispatched detached and the launcher closes immediately. An
entry that opens a player or a window has nothing further to say, and waiting
would strand the launcher on screen for as long as the thing it launched lives.

## Prefix extension

Prefix extensions turn a prefix and prompt into an action:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "pi-agent",
  "capability": "pi-agent",
  "mode": "prefix",
  "label": "Pi Agent",
  "prefixes": ["pi"],
  "icon": "",
  "iconFont": "omarchy",
  "description": "Start new session",
  "requires": ["pi"],
  "command": ["omarchy-launch-terminal", "pi", "--", "{prompt}"]
}
```

Typing part of a prefix shows the extension as a result. Activating it completes the prefix and keeps Omalaunch focused for prompt entry.

## File browser extension

File browser extensions provide navigation, recursive search, opening, and path copying:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "example.files",
  "capability": "files",
  "mode": "files",
  "label": "Files",
  "prefixes": ["files"],
  "root": "~",
  "requires": ["fd", "fzf", "jq", "python", "xdg-open", "xdg-terminal-exec", "wl-copy"],
  "command": ["xdg-open", "{path}"],
  "directoryCommand": ["xdg-open", "{path}"],
  "terminalCommand": ["xdg-terminal-exec", "--dir={path}"],
  "copyCommand": ["wl-copy", "--", "{path}"],
  "copyFileCommand": ["copy-file-uri", "{path}"]
}
```

Ctrl+H toggles hidden files for the current file-browser session. Ctrl+K opens the contextual Action Panel. `command` opens files, `directoryCommand` opens directories in the file manager, `terminalCommand` opens a terminal, `copyCommand` copies the path, and `copyFileCommand` places a file URI on the clipboard. All command fields support `{path}`. Files and directories can be starred from the Action Panel or with Ctrl+S and then opened directly from the launcher’s starting view. Each star belongs to the exact provider that created it, so a replacement does not inherit bundled Files favorites. The bundled implementation starts at the home directory, uses `fd` traversal and fzf path ranking, omits hidden and ignored paths by default, includes hidden paths except `.git` internals for the current session after Ctrl+H, and limits each ranked result set to 100 entries. Exact basename matches rank before paths that match only through a parent directory, so many descendants cannot hide a matching file or directory. Recursive candidates are indexed once per active directory and reused while typing; the index refreshes after 30 seconds or when navigation changes directories.

## Emoji picker extension

Emoji picker extensions contribute a searchable grid of emoji:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "example.emoji",
  "capability": "emoji",
  "mode": "emoji",
  "label": "Emoji",
  "prefixes": ["emoji"],
  "icon": "",
  "description": "Press Enter to paste",
  "requires": ["omarchy-menu-emoji-insert", "wtype", "wl-copy"],
  "data": ["{extensionDir}/emojis.json"],
  "groups": "{extensionDir}/groups.json",
  "command": ["omarchy-menu-emoji-insert", "{emoji}"],
  "copyCommand": ["wl-copy", "--", "{emoji}"]
}
```

`data` is the dataset the grid searches. It may be one path or an ordered list
of at most eight candidates, read in order until one loads and parses to at
least one emoji; a file that is missing, unreadable, or parses to nothing falls
through to the next. Only `{omarchyPath}` and `{extensionDir}` expand, each
result must be an absolute path, and a candidate containing `..` is dropped
without discarding the safe ones.

The bundled provider lists two: the set Omarchy ships, then its own copy.
Omarchy's comes first so the data stays current with the system, and the
bundled copy means disabling or removing the `omarchy.emojis` plugin, or an
Omarchy release that stops shipping it, cannot take the picker with it.

The file holds an array of `{"e": "😀", "k": "grinning face smile happy"}`
objects; `{"emoji": …, "keywords": …}` and an `{"emojis": [ … ]}` wrapper are
also accepted. Duplicate glyphs, empty glyphs, non-objects, and malformed JSON
are dropped, and the grid reads at most 8192 entries and displays at most 1000
results.

`extraData` names an optional supplementary set, resolved under the same rules
as `data`, whose entries are **appended** to the dataset rather than replacing
it. Because categories are derived by scanning the dataset in order, a set
appended at the end becomes its own category with nothing more than one further
boundary in the groups file. The bundled provider uses this for currency sign
characters — `$`, `€`, `£`, `¥` and the rest — which the emoji set does not
carry at all. A glyph the dataset already has is dropped from the supplement,
so it never gets a second cell.

`groups` names an optional category file and resolves under the same rules,
including the candidate list. It
lists the first emoji of each category, in the order the dataset uses:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "groups": [
    { "label": "Smileys & Emotion", "start": "😀" },
    { "label": "People & Body", "start": "👋" }
  ]
}
```

A category runs from its first emoji up to the next one's, so the file stays
small and emoji added inside a category are grouped without touching it. That
holds only while the dataset keeps that order, so a boundary that is missing,
out of order, or not at the start of the dataset abandons grouping entirely and
leaves one flat grid rather than mislabeling half of it. JSONC comments and
trailing commas are accepted.

While browsing, the grid leads with **Frequently Used** — the sixteen most-used
emoji, ranked from pasting rather than from any explicit action — and then each
category. A frequently used emoji remains listed in its own category too, so a
category is never missing entries. A query replaces all of it with one ranked,
unlabelled list, because category order and ranking cannot both hold.

`command` pastes the selected emoji and `copyCommand` places it on the
clipboard; both support `{emoji}`. Declare every executable the paste path
needs, including the ones a helper script calls: Omarchy's insert helper
swallows a `wtype` failure, so an undeclared `wtype` would make pasting a
silent no-op instead of a visible missing dependency. Enter pastes and closes the launcher, Ctrl+C
copies and keeps the grid open so several emoji can be collected in one
session. Both record usage, so recently and frequently used emoji lead an
unfiltered grid.

Searching matches whole words and word prefixes across an entry's keywords —
`smi fac` finds `smiling face`, and every term must match. A keyword at the
front of an entry outranks one at the back. Match quality always outranks usage
history, so a search never leads with an emoji that does not match it.

The grid has no pinning: usage ranking does the same job without asking for an
action first. Recents are keyed by capability, so replacing the provider keeps
the history. The stored key still reads `emoji.favorite:` because pinning once
shared it; renaming it would orphan every recent already recorded.

Left and Right move one cell, Up and Down move one row, PageUp and PageDown
move one screen, and Escape clears the query and then leaves the picker. Rows
are eight emoji wide. Vertical movement is walked through the layout rather
than by adding a column count, because a category's last row can be short and
a header breaks the stride.

A picker reached through a summon route has no launcher behind it, so leaving
it closes the launcher instead of revealing a starting view the keybinding
never asked for. Reached from the launcher, leaving returns there as usual.
The same applies to the file browser and to workflows.

## Clipboard history extension

Clipboard history extensions browse and paste what Omarchy's clipboard capture
has recorded:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "example.clipboard",
  "capability": "clipboard",
  "mode": "clipboard",
  "label": "Clipboard History",
  "prefixes": ["clip"],
  "requires": ["omarchy-clipboard-paste-text", "omarchy-clipboard-paste-file"],
  "history": ["{stateHome}/omarchy/clipboard-history.json"],
  "command": ["omarchy-clipboard-paste-text", "--shift-insert", "--history-index", "{index}"],
  "copyCommand": ["omarchy-clipboard-paste-text", "--copy-only", "--history-index", "{index}"],
  "fileCommand": ["omarchy-clipboard-paste-file", "{mime}", "{path}"],
  "fileCopyCommand": ["omarchy-clipboard-paste-file", "--copy-only", "{mime}", "{path}"]
}
```

`history` is an ordered candidate list resolved like the emoji `data` field,
with `{stateHome}` added for the XDG state directory. Omalaunch reads that file
and never writes it: Omarchy's capture owns it. The file is watched, so a copy
made anywhere shows up without reopening the launcher.

`command` and `copyCommand` support `{index}` — the entry's index in the history
file. `fileCommand` and `fileCopyCommand` support `{path}` and `{mime}`.

**Text is passed by index, never as an argument.** Omarchy's helper reads the
entry back from the file itself. Putting clipboard text on a command line would
expose it in a process listing, and clipboard history holds passwords.

Only a prefix of each entry is scanned or rendered — 8192 characters. A single
large paste otherwise costs hundreds of megabytes of string work on every
keystroke and stalls the shell. Pasting is unaffected, because the helper reads
the entry in full.

Rows carry an icon and a one-line title; everything else about the selected
entry — the content itself, then its type, size, and origin — goes in the
detail pane beside the list. Enter pastes and closes; Ctrl+C copies without
pasting. Searching is a plain case-insensitive substring, since a remembered
fragment is how a clipboard gets searched.

## Workflow extension

Workflow extensions contribute a launcher entry and a bounded tree of host-rendered stages. They can compose menus, text input, and Omalaunch's host-provided directory picker without shipping QML or implementing filesystem navigation:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "example.projects",
  "mode": "workflow",
  "label": "Example",
  "prefixes": ["example"],
  "requires": ["example-cli", "xdg-terminal-exec", "fd", "fzf", "python"],
  "workflow": {
    "items": [{
      "id": "projects",
      "kind": "menu",
      "label": "Projects",
      "items": [{
        "id": "add",
        "kind": "directoryPicker",
        "label": "Add Project…",
        "next": {
          "id": "name",
          "kind": "input",
          "label": "Name project",
          "prompt": "Project name",
          "default": "{basename}",
          "maxLength": 120,
          "command": ["{extensionDir}/bin/projects", "add", "{path}", "{input}"]
        }
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

Supported node kinds are `menu`, `directoryPicker`, `input`, `action`, and `confirm`. Menus contain `items`; a directory picker requires a `next` node; an input may run `command` and then enter `next`. Action and confirmation nodes run a direct command; confirmation nodes use `confirm` and optional `confirmLabel` text. Directory selection supplies `{path}` and `{basename}`. Input supplies `{input}`. `{extensionDir}` is the contributing extension's source directory. A node's bounded string-only `context` is inherited by its descendants. `default` initializes an input, `maxLength` bounds it, and `allowEmpty` permits submission without text. `emptyCommand` selects a distinct argument array for empty input. `refreshExtensions` reloads dynamic catalogs after a successful action. `nextBackSteps` can collapse transient input/picker history after a successful save.

Commands are executed directly as argument arrays. Placeholder substitution never invokes a shell, so paths, names, and prompts remain literal arguments. Workflow trees are capped at 256 nodes and eight levels. Extensions cannot contribute QML. Escape returns through workflow stages. The directory picker reuses the Files index/browse implementation but selects directories instead of opening them. Contextual workflow Ctrl+K actions are intentionally left as a future extension point; workflow definitions do not opt into the global Files Action Panel.

A validated terminal leaf command whose executable is `xdg-terminal-exec` or `omarchy-launch-terminal` is dispatched detached, then Omalaunch closes and resets immediately; the launcher does not wait for a terminal wrapper to exit. Empty-input and other pre-dispatch validation failures leave the workflow open. Non-terminal commands and commands with a following stage wait for successful completion before navigating or closing. After 30 seconds, or when their workflow/session/catalog is left or replaced, Omalaunch sends SIGTERM to the tracked direct child; if it has not exited after a one-second grace period, Omalaunch sends that same generation's direct child SIGKILL. This guarantees release of the reusable Quickshell `Process` even when the direct child ignores SIGTERM. Quickshell's `Process.signal()` targets the direct process, not a process group, so independently surviving descendants are not guaranteed to be terminated. Generation checks prevent a stale process exit or kill timer from changing a later launcher session.

## Actionable dynamic-menu extension

Dynamic-menu extensions let a trusted external plugin calculate a short menu when the user opens its shortcut. The provider is a direct argument-array command:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "example.quicklinks",
  "capability": "quicklinks",
  "mode": "menu",
  "label": "Quicklinks",
  "prefixes": ["links"],
  "requires": ["quicklinks"],
  "command": ["quicklinks", "menu", "--json"]
}
```

The provider receives no stdin. It writes one JSON object with an `items` array, or writes the array directly. A result can contain at most 100 rows. The process has a five-second timeout and a 256 KiB stdout limit. Invalid JSON, a nonzero exit, excessive output, duplicate row IDs, an invalid row, or an excessive row count rejects the complete snapshot. Omalaunch does not run a partial menu. Leaving the menu or closing the launcher makes the old generation stale, so its result cannot replace a later menu. Providers must be fast and should only read state.

A basic row runs `command` directly:

```json
{
  "items": [{
    "id": "docs",
    "label": "Project documentation",
    "description": "example.test/docs",
    "icon": "󰈙",
    "command": ["xdg-open", "https://example.test/docs"]
  }]
}
```

Every row requires a unique, nonempty `id` and a nonempty `label`. An ordinary row also requires a nonempty argument-array `command`. A row can set a short `badge` string for a host-rendered trailing count or status pill; badge text is limited to 16 characters. Set `badgeTone` to `neutral`, `success`, `danger`, `warning`, or `info` for semantic host styling; invalid or omitted tones use `neutral`. A row can set `trailingText` for an always-visible date or other short metadata; it is limited to 64 characters. Presentation strings and command arguments are bounded. Omalaunch does not invoke a shell and does not expand command text. `{extensionDir}` and form `{input}` values are substituted as complete literal arguments. Set `closeOnSuccess: true` for commands that should close Omalaunch after they exit successfully. Set `closeOnDispatch: true` only for commands that launch an independent editor, terminal, or application and should close Omalaunch immediately without waiting for that process to exit. Other successful menu commands reload the provider so mutations appear immediately.

A row can load another host-rendered menu on demand instead of running a primary action:

```json
{
  "id": "issues",
  "label": "Issues",
  "context": { "repository": "example/project" },
  "submenu": {
    "command": ["{extensionDir}/bin/provider", "issues", "{repository}"]
  }
}
```

The submenu command uses the row context and returns the same bounded dynamic-menu JSON format as the root provider. Nested rows can open more submenus or detail documents. Press Ctrl+R in a dynamic menu, submenu, or detail document to run its provider again without leaving the current navigation path. A `submenu` or `document` can declare an optional `refreshCommand` beside `command`. Initial activation runs `command`; Ctrl+R runs `refreshCommand`. This lets a provider use cached data for navigation while keeping refresh explicitly live. Without `refreshCommand`, both operations use `command`. Omalaunch runs a submenu provider only after activation. It receives no stdin, has a five-second timeout, and has a 256 KiB limit on each output stream. Leaving the submenu, closing the launcher, replacing its session, or changing its provider invalidates the request. Cancellation sends SIGTERM and then sends SIGKILL to the same direct child after a 500 ms grace period. Submenu commands run directly as argument arrays and support the row context plus `{extensionDir}` placeholders.

A row cannot declare both `submenu` and `document`. Recursive use remains bounded by the existing eight-level workflow navigation limit in the normalized provider data and by user-driven navigation history in the host.

A row can open an on-demand, host-rendered detail document instead of running a primary action:

```json
{
  "id": "issue:142",
  "label": "Fix authentication timeout",
  "description": "example/project #142",
  "context": { "repository": "example/project", "number": "142" },
  "document": {
    "command": ["{extensionDir}/bin/provider", "issue", "{repository}", "{number}"]
  }
}
```

The detail command uses the row context and writes one structured JSON object:

```json
{

`title` is required. `subtitle`, `status`, `icon`, and `iconFont` are optional. A document can include up to six statistic cards through `stats`; each card requires `label` and `value` and can include `icon` and `iconFont`. A document also accepts at most 32 label/value fields, 16 plain-text sections, and 16 host-rendered actions. The complete normalized document text is limited to 64 KiB. Sections default to `format: "plain"`. A section can set `format: "markdown"` for host-rendered headings, emphasis, lists, block quotes, inline code, fenced code blocks, and safe HTTP or HTTPS links. Raw HTML is escaped, unsafe links remain text, and images and extension QML are not loaded. Code blocks use a separate scrollable monospace surface with a Copy code control. Ctrl+K opens the document actions. Escape returns to the source list.

Omalaunch runs the detail provider only after activation. It receives no stdin, has a five-second timeout, and has a 256 KiB limit on each output stream. Leaving the document, closing the launcher, replacing its session, or changing its provider invalidates the request. Cancellation sends SIGTERM and then sends SIGKILL to the same direct child after a 500 ms grace period. Detail commands run directly as argument arrays and support the row context plus `{extensionDir}` placeholders.

A row can ask for confirmation before dispatch:

```json
{
  "id": "remove",
  "label": "Remove link",
  "confirm": "Remove this saved link?",
  "confirmLabel": "Remove",
  "command": ["quicklinks", "remove", "docs"],
  "refreshExtensions": true
}
```

A row can open a host-rendered text input form. The input object supports the workflow input fields `prompt`, `default`, `maxLength`, `allowEmpty`, `emptyCommand`, `command`, and `next`. An input with `capture` stores its literal value under that named context key for interpolation by the next stage. This permits multi-step forms without temporary plugin state; backing out cancels the unfinished flow.

```json
{
  "id": "add",
  "label": "Add link",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "URL",
    "maxLength": 2048,
    "command": ["quicklinks", "add", "{input}"]
  },
  "refreshExtensions": true
}
```

A row can include up to 16 `actions`. Press Ctrl+K on that row to open its contextual action list. Each contextual action has the same direct command, confirmation, input, and refresh fields as a row, but actions cannot contain more nested actions. A row can set `starAction` to the ID of one direct contextual action; Ctrl+S then runs that action through the normal tracked lifecycle. Providers should update the row's `starred` value and the action label/command in the next snapshot. Set `starredLabel` when a starred shortcut needs more context than its menu label. The menu continues to show `label`; the top-level and global-search snapshot uses `starredLabel` only while the row is starred.

Menu and action commands use the workflow action lifecycle. A non-terminal direct child runs for at most 30 seconds. Cancellation sends SIGTERM and then sends SIGKILL to the same direct child after one second. Stale generation checks prevent old exits from changing a new session. A successful menu mutation reloads the provider so the visible rows show current state. `refreshExtensions: true` also reloads the extension catalog after success. Failed commands leave the current menu open and do not refresh it.

Set the extension field `globalSearch: true` to include provider rows in Omalaunch general search. The default is `false`, so omitted and false values keep the current shortcut-only behavior. By default, Omalaunch uses the provider's top-level `items` for both its visible menu and global search. A provider can separate these surfaces with an explicit `globalSearchItems` collection:

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "id": "repositories", "label": "Repositories", "submenu": { "command": ["provider", "repositories"] } }
  ],
  "globalSearchItems": [
    { "id": "repo:example/project", "label": "example/project", "submenu": { "command": ["provider", "repository", "example/project"] } }
  ]
}
```

When `globalSearchItems` is present, only that collection supplies global search rows; its rows do not appear in the opened extension menu. An explicit empty collection disables result contribution while the extension root remains searchable. Each collection has its own 100-row limit and uses the same row schema and validation. Array responses and objects without `globalSearchItems` retain the original shared-collection behavior.

If building global search data is slower than building the visible menu, declare a separate extension-level `globalSearchCommand`:

```json
{
  "mode": "menu",
  "globalSearch": true,
  "command": ["provider", "menu"],
  "globalSearchCommand": ["provider", "global-search"]
}
```

Opening the extension runs only `command`. Global-search preload runs `globalSearchCommand` independently and treats its normal array or `items` output as the search source. This lets a static extension menu open without waiting for network-backed search data. `globalSearchCommand` is accepted only for a global-search-enabled menu extension and has the same 32-argument and bounded-string validation as `command`.

An opted-in provider can set `globalSearch: false` on an individual row to omit it from general search. Omalaunch preloads opted-in, available providers and searches each row by `label`, `description`, and optional string or string-array `aliases`. A row with `starred: true` also appears on the launcher's top-level starting view; non-starred rows remain search-only. The extension root remains visible as a separate search result. Activating a cached row runs the same primary command, including confirmation or input handling, and honors `closeOnSuccess`. Ctrl+K opens the row's cached contextual actions.

The preload is one atomic cached snapshot. Omalaunch keeps the last complete snapshot if one provider fails, times out, returns invalid or excessive output, or exceeds an aggregate safeguard. At most 16 opted-in providers, 1,000 searchable rows, 1 MiB of output, and ten seconds of aggregate preload time are accepted; the existing five-second, 256 KiB, and 100-row limits still apply to each provider. Catalog changes and successful menu mutations invalidate and reload the snapshot. Generation checks reject stale provider exits. Providers must return all searchable state in the normal bounded menu response; Omalaunch does not run providers for each keystroke.

Dynamic menus are for small actionable collections, not unbounded search results or a persistent RPC protocol. The plugin remains trusted local software; argument arrays prevent accidental shell parsing but do not sandbox it.

### Launching the default coding agent

Use Omalaunch's shared agent launcher and `closeOnDispatch` for an extension action that hands work to the user's default coding agent:

```json
{
  "id": "edit-with-agent",
  "label": "Edit with agent",
  "command": [
    "{omalaunchDir}/libexec/omalaunch-launch-agent",
    "--dir", "{extensionDir}",
    "--prompt", "Help the user configure this extension."
  ],
  "closeOnDispatch": true
}
```

`{omalaunchDir}` is the active Omalaunch plugin directory. The shared launcher checks that a default agent is selected, expands `~` and environment variables in the directory, changes to that existing directory, and replaces itself with `omarchy-agent --prompt`. `closeOnDispatch` lets Omalaunch close without waiting for the terminal agent. Declare `omarchy-agent` and `omarchy-default-agent` in the extension's `requires` list.

Extensions remain responsible for preparing their files and directories and building their prompt. A preparation helper should replace itself with `omalaunch-launch-agent` after setup. Do not start an intermediate detached process or call `xdg-terminal-exec`; the shared launcher and `omarchy-agent` apply consistent validation, working-directory behavior, and standard Omarchy terminal behavior.

## Live-query extension

Live-query extensions recognize input, run asynchronously, and display the command output:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "id": "example.calculator",
  "capability": "calculator",
  "mode": "query",
  "label": "Calculator",
  "icon": "󰃬",
  "description": "Press Enter to copy",
  "priority": 10,
  "requires": ["example-calculator", "wl-copy"],
  "match": {
    "all": ["^\\s*\\d"],
    "any": ["[+\\-*/%]"] ,
    "none": ["[+\\-*/%(]\\s*$"]
  },
  "command": ["example-calculator", "{query}"],
  "resultCommand": ["wl-copy", "--", "{result}"]
}
```

`normalizeUnits` opts a provider into unit rewriting before its command runs.
qalc reads an abbreviated plural as the singular times seconds — `lbs` is
`lb·s`, `kms` is `km·s` — and a bare temperature letter as a physics constant:
`c` the speed of light, `f` femto, `k` kilo. So `180 lbs to kg` answered
`81.65 kg·s` and `100 c to f` answered `2.99e25 fm/s`. With the flag set, those
spellings are rewritten to the ones qalc evaluates, and the rewritten query is
what the result row displays, so the row says what was actually evaluated.

SI-prefixed seconds (`ms`, `ns`, `ps`, `us`, `fs`) are deliberately never
rewritten, and a bare `c`, `f`, or `k` is only read as a temperature when both
sides of the conversion are temperatures — so `500 ms to s` and `3 c to m` are
left alone. The flag defaults to false, so a third-party query provider is
never rewritten.

The same flag gives a lone amount and unit its implied counterpart: `1 inch`
becomes `1 inch to cm`, `80 kg` becomes `80 kg to lb`. Each pair crosses the
metric/imperial line, which is the only reading that makes a lone unit worth
converting. A stated target always wins. A one-letter unit must be separated
from the amount — `500 g` converts, `5g` does not — which is what keeps `4k`,
`5g`, and `1080p` out of the calculator; the extension's `match` rules carry
the same restriction so such a query never reaches it in the first place.

Match rules are case-insensitive regular expressions:

- Every expression in `all` must match.
- At least one expression in `any` must match when `any` is present.
- No expression in `none` may match.

The highest-priority matching live-query extension runs. Live queries debounce for 140 ms, run for at most five seconds, and retain only the latest pending query while a prior direct child exits. Query text, provider identity, command, and generation metadata remain immutable for that child. Replacement, timeout, empty input, focus/catalog changes, and launcher close send SIGTERM; after a 500 ms grace period a generation-matched direct child receives SIGKILL. Only `onExited` releases the reusable process and launches the latest pending query, and revision/provider/query checks reject stale output. As with workflow actions, independently surviving descendants are outside this direct-child lifecycle guarantee.

## Replacement

`capability` identifies interchangeable behavior. For each capability Omalaunch selects one extension:

1. An available provider selected in the user configuration wins.
2. Without an available configured provider, higher `priority` wins.
3. At equal priority, an external extension wins over a bundled extension.
4. If the configured provider is missing or unavailable, Omalaunch reports a diagnostic and uses the normal rules above.
5. If an external extension is disabled or removed, another available provider, including the bundled provider, becomes active.

## Common fields

- `schemaVersion`: Extension format version; currently `1`.
- `id`: Stable, unique extension identifier.
- `capability`: Stable behavior being supplied or replaced; defaults to `id`.
- `mode`: `action`, `prefix`, `query`, `files`, `workflow`, `emoji`, `clipboard`, or `menu`; defaults to `prefix`.
- `label`, `icon`, `iconFont`, `description`: Result presentation.
- `rootDescription`: Optional description for the extension shortcut in Extensions and global search. Use it when activating the extension differs from activating one of its results; defaults to `description`.
- `priority`: Selection priority; defaults to `0`.
- `requires`: Executable names that must be available on `PATH`.
- `command`: Argument array. Prefix mode supports `{prompt}`; query mode supports `{query}`; menu providers support `{extensionDir}`.

Commands are argument arrays. Omalaunch substitutes placeholders and shell-quotes action arguments. Do not embed pipes, redirects, or other shell syntax.

Missing dependencies leave an extension visible but unavailable with a clear message; its command cannot be activated. Omalaunch logs diagnostics for malformed definitions, unsupported schemas, duplicate IDs or prefixes, invalid regular expressions, and missing dependencies.

The `requires` field declares executable requirements only. It does not authorize package installation, and external extensions cannot provide commands for Omalaunch to install system packages. Omalaunch may offer explicit installation only for dependencies in its own trusted allow-list, after showing the exact command and receiving user confirmation.

Malformed extensions are ignored. Omarchy plugins are trusted local software and extension commands run as the current user.

## Configuration

Omalaunch reads its core settings from the dedicated `~/.config/omarchy/omalaunch/config.jsonc` file. JSONC comments and trailing commas are accepted. Invalid, oversized (more than 64 KiB), over-depth, or unsupported configuration is ignored with a diagnostic. Only settings that Omalaunch validates are copied into its runtime configuration; other data does not become an extension setting.

Select a provider by extension `id` in `config.jsonc`. The key is the capability identity. If the requested provider is missing or unavailable, Omalaunch reports it and uses normal priority and replacement resolution.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  // Optional parent for workspaces created by Extensions > Add Extension.
  "extensionDevelopmentDirectory": "~/Development/omalaunch-extensions",
  "capabilities": {
    "files": { "provider": "example.files" },
    // Bundled extensions ship enabled and cannot be uninstalled, so this is
    // how one is turned off.
    "emoji": { "enabled": false },
  },
}
```

Select a row in **Extensions** and press Delete to switch its capability off
from the launcher itself. That writes
`~/.local/state/omarchy/omalaunch-capabilities.json`, alongside the favorites
and usage stores; `config.jsonc` is hand-authored and Omalaunch never rewrites
it. A capability whose `enabled` is written out in `config.jsonc` is pinned
there, so its row reports **Disabled in configuration** and Delete does
nothing — the configured value always wins.

A capability switched off from the row stays listed in **Extensions**, dimmed
and labelled, because that row is the only way to switch it back on. It is
absent from everywhere else: the starting view, global search, prefixes, live
queries, and activation. An external extension's dialog also names
`omarchy plugin remove <id>`, since disabling leaves its plugin installed.

`enabled` defaults to true. Setting it to false drops every provider of that
capability before resolution, so it leaves no shortcut in **Extensions** at
all — not even a dimmed one — no prefix, no global-search entry, and nothing
for another provider to fall back to. It applies to bundled and external
providers alike; an external plugin can also be removed outright with
`omarchy plugin remove`, but a bundled extension has no other off switch.

The value must be a real boolean — a string like `"false"` is refused with a
diagnostic rather than treated as truthy, so a typo cannot quietly remove a
feature. A capability may carry `enabled`, `provider`, or both; a `provider`
recorded alongside `enabled: false` is kept, so switching the capability back
on restores the selection rather than losing it, and it is not reported as a
misconfiguration while the capability is off. Removing the key, or setting it
to true, restores the capability on the next launcher open.

The launcher keeps one size so it never resizes as results come and go or as
the detail pane opens. Both numbers are settable, in points:

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "launcher": { "width": 660, "height": 460 },
}
```

`width` accepts 320-2000 and `height` 240-1600; anything outside that, or a
non-integer, is ignored with a diagnostic and the default is kept. dmenu
requests keep their own dynamic sizing, because the caller states a width and a
three-option prompt should not be a full-height panel.

Provider settings are separate from capability selection. User-edited JSONC is under `~/.config/omarchy/omalaunch/extensions/`; machine-managed JSON state is under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/omarchy/omalaunch/extensions/`. Both use the exact provider ID as the filename. A replacement provider never inherits, merges, or shares either namespace. UI mutations write only state and never rewrite JSONC comments or formatting.

The exact structures, supported versions, defaults, limits, identities, path rules, and separate configuration and state schemas are in [PROVIDER-CONFIGURATION.md](PROVIDER-CONFIGURATION.md). Apps and Extensions have no user configuration file. Files has only `includeGitIgnored` in configuration. Web Search defines its engine IDs, names, URL templates, and extension-wide `rankByUsage` setting in configuration; menu actions store global-search exclusions in state without removing engines from the Web Search menu. Quicklinks has only `rankByUsage`, which defaults to true and applies only to the exact bundled provider ID. Quicklinks uses state as the authoritative editable location for each link's `openWith` assignment and does not import external or unreleased Quicklinks data.

The bundled `omalaunch.quicklinks` extension is URL-only. It supports add, name and URL edits, delete, URL copy, default or configured browser-profile opening, filtering, global search, and extension-owned stars. It does not use favicons, file paths, or profile-editing UI.
